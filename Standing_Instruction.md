## Comprehensive Guidelines and Information

**Standing Instructions**

Before you delve into utilizing my software, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with these standing instructions. I want to emphasize that I bear no responsibility for any damage to your phone or offer support for instances of carelessness or actions not explicitly outlined here.

**Roms**

When it comes to my custom ROMs, I've incorporated several important features and qualities to enhance your user experience. Here's an overview of what you can expect:

- **FBE V2 Encryption:** All ROMs for my devices feature FBE V2 encryption, optimized for eMMC.
- **Build Type:** I typically provide user/userdebug builds, with the exception of the initial days following a new Android/ROM release.
- **SELinux Enforcement:** My ROMs come with SELinux enforcement by default, providing enhanced security (except for the initial release days).
- **Neverallow:** You'll find that my ROMs do not include any "neverallow" restrictions (with the exception of the initial release days).
- **CTS Compatibility:** All my ROMs pass Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) by default. In case Google alters server-side settings, be patient for a fix.
- **Google Play Store Certification:** You'll be pleased to know that all my ROMs are certified in the Google Play Store.
- **Modifications and Hacks:** While I don't actively encourage the use of modifications or hacks, you're free to employ them at your own risk. Please note that I won't provide support for such alterations.
- **DFE and Kernel:** Avoid flashing DFE separately, and refrain from changing the default kernel in the ROM. If you do decide to change it, make sure to choose a kernel that supports OSS Camera, QTI haptics, QTI PERF, and Aidl vibrator-based light HAL.
- **Updates:** For installing updates, use ADB SIDELOAD with the provided recovery that is inbuilt.
- **Kernel Details:** The kernels used in all my ROMs and recoveries can be found at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Atom-X-Devs/android_kernel_xiaomi_scarlet).

**Recovery**

Regarding the custom recovery, please be aware of its current capabilities:

- **Flashing Functionality:** As of now, my custom recovery is fully functional for flashing purposes.
- **Decryption Issue:** However, it is not equipped to decrypt data independently. I am actively working on resolving this issue in the future, so stay tuned for updates.

By adhering to these guidelines and taking advantage of the features and safeguards integrated into my ROMs, you can ensure a smoother and more secure Android experience.

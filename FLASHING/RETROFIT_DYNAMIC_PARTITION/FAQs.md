1) Can we revert back to A/B partitioning and flash older ROMS

        Yes, you can. You just have to wipe system partition in the recovery and flash the ROM

2) Do we have to flash super_empty.img everytime we flash a update

        Not necessarily, but if you have wiped the system partition then you need to flash super_empty.img again

• Our system partiton is so small (Nearly only 3GB) but as android version is increasing and Gapps and other system apps sizes are increasing we wont be able to flash ROM in our phones.

• So to fix that issues I (Immanuel) combined system and vendor and made it as a dynamic partiton.

• Flashing super_empty.img will utilize the storage of both system and vendor partions as one.

• So space of vendor and system is combined now.

• So we have more than 3GB now.

• In this one big partiton i make smaller partion like system, vendor, product, etc instead of seperate pariton.

• This partiton is dynamic that it can change its size by itself, like if update this month is 3..1 gb for exampe and the rest space is given to the users to use it, it can be scaled as well.

• Also this will allow us to use the DSU as well.
